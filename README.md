# Machine-Learning-Project-for-ITC
This is a internship project by Career Launcher.

## Welcome!

Investment Bankers . CA's . Hedge Fund / Portfolio Managers . Forex traders . Commodities Analysts. These have been historically considered to be among the most coveted professions of all time. Yet, if one fails to keep up with the demands of the day, one would find one's skills to be obsolete in this era of data analysis. Data Science has inarguably been the hottest domain of the decade, asserting its need in every single sphere of corporate life. It was not long agowhen we discovered the massive potential of incorporating ML/AI in the financial world. Now, the very idea of the two being disjointed sounds strange. Data Science has been incremental in providing powerful insights ( which people didn't even know existed ) and helped massively increase the efficiency, helping everyone from a scalp trader to a long term debt investor. Accurate predictions, unbiased analysis, powerful tools that run through millions of rows of data in the blink of an eye have transformed the industry in ways we could've never imagined. The following program is designed to both test your knowledge and to give you the feel and experience of a real world financial world - data science problem.

## Datasets used for module 2 onwards
From module 2 onwards, I've accessed the data of various other stocks, index and commodities.The links for the same have been provided in this section
## 1. Stocks
### Small Cap
Small cap is a term used to classify companies with a relatively `small market capitalization`. A company's market capitalization is the market value of its outstanding shares. In India, normally a company below market capitalization of Rs.5000 crores is classified as small cap company. One can expect a relatively high volatility in Small Cap companies.

### Mid Cap
A mid-cap company is a company with `Mid market capitalization` above Rs.5000 crores and less than Rs.20000 crores . As the name implies, a mid-cap company falls in the middle of the pack between large-cap and small-cap companies, considered to be a safer investment than small cap companies at the cost larger possible gains.

### Large Cap
Large cap (sometimes “big cap”) is a shortened version of the term `large market capitalization.` In India, normally companies with the market capitalization higher than Rs.20,000 crores are considered as Large cap companies. Considered to be the safest of all equities, with very rare 'big' moves.
